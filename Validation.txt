External Aerodynamics (CFD)
Simulate wind flow at 120 m/s over a sports car
Study cross-wind effects of 30 m/s on a bus
 
Aerospace / High-Speed Flow
Simulate airflow at 250 m/s over an aircraft wing
Study airflow at Mach 0.6 over a blunt nose cone
 
Internal Flow (Inlet / Outlet based)
Simulate air entering a duct at 25 m/s
Analyze pressure drop in a cooling channel with airflow of 5 m/s
 
Thermal + Flow (still PoC-friendly)
Simulate hot air flow at 60 m/s and 350 K over a heat sink
Analyze cooling airflow of 15 m/s around an electronic enclosure
Test forced convection at 10 m/s over a heated plate
 
Simple Educational 
Test laminar airflow at 2 m/s in a rectangular channel
Simulate turbulent airflow at 40 m/s in a circular pipe
Compare airflow at 10 m/s vs 30 m/s around a cylinder
